_Your study and submission work here..._
1: I did the exercises but didn't commit the changes and I wrote everything down on this notebook. Lesson learned: Save constantly and write out notes.

2.3:
2.4: 2.62V on voltmeter measuring at the HV terminal.
2.5: Had trouble setting up the circuit. Was connecting to the long board ground and not the Microbit ground. Still 2.62V.

3.1: Set up circuit and used the driver code from the read-me. The LED isn't very bright in the video but it was full strength in person. 

4.1: Set up circuit using the diagram. Had an issue where the outputs would not behave as expected when connected to ground. The groundless circuit would cause the Q1 to be constantly on while Q| would blink out of sync with the clock. When grounded the Q| would stay on and the Q would stop being illuminated.
